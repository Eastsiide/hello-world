This is my first time on GitHub. I am building a start-up and I am trying to learn all avenues. I enjoy learning new things. I am a visual learner and need to be hands-on. I'm looking forward to learning and putting in the blood, sweat and tears for my baby. I always try to remind myseld that I deserve success just like everyone else. Pushing myself and striving to reach my full potential is the only way I will get there. A quote to remind me of such progress in from my favorite movie, 'A Bronx Tale', "The Saddest Thing in Life is Wasted Talent". -Robert Deniro-
